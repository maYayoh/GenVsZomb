As the last remaining forces against evil (as we all know those are zombies), defend yourself with generators.
(Flamethrowers may be useful too!)

Unfortunately there are too many of them to hope to kill them all (and it wouldn't be very nice, they may eat brains, but they're still nice people insideðŸ˜£).

"Mess around, find out, die trying! It's totally fine" - *Not* a Zomb

You only need the left mouse click to interact with everything. Have fun!



*(viewport is in 640\*640, but the game is running in 64\*64)
(we tried to incorporate the "invasion" and "catch 'em all" themes)*

# HOW TO PLAY

- The goal of the game is to cure the zombies. To do that you need to build laboratories and let zombies inside.
- Once you have study enough zombies (you can check your progress by clicking on the flask in the bottom menu during the day), you can make the cure!

- Build towers to defend yourself. You can disable them if you need by clicking on them during a night
- Towers and laboratories need energy. You can build generators to provide that.

- Survive. Don't let come closer.
